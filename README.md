# InfluxDB Visualizations

Visualize InfluxDB query results by using the **3rd party React components**.

This project is a playground for **React front developers** that look for ways to
**visualize InfluxDB query results** by using the 3rd party React components. For
the dashboard use case, the
[Influxdata Giraffe](https://github.com/influxdata/giraffe) project is not
always an option.

Alternatively, some of the most popular graph/visualization React-based data
visualization libraries are easy to use, too.

In this repository, we present **Nivo** and **Recharts**.
